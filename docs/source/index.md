**hapsira** is an open source ([MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)) pure Python library for interactive Astrodynamics and Orbital Mechanics, with a focus on ease of use, speed, and quick visualization. It provides a simple and intuitive {ref}`API <api-reference>`, and handles physical quantities with units. It's a fork of [poliastro](http://github.com/poliastro/poliastro), aiming at continuing its development.

View the [source code](https://github.com/pleiszenburg/hapsira) of `hapsira`!

Some of its awesome features are:

- Analytical and numerical orbit propagation
- Conversion between position and velocity vectors and classical orbital elements
- Coordinate frame transformations
- Hohmann and bielliptic maneuvers computation
- Trajectory plotting
- Initial orbit determination (Lambert problem)
- Planetary ephemerides (using [SPICE kernels](https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/data.html) via [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/))
- Computation of Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

And more to come!

`hapsira` is developed by an open, international community. Release announcements and general discussion take place on our [mailing list](https://groups.io/g/hapsira-dev) and [chat](https://matrix.to/#/#hapsira:matrix.org).

## Success stories from the original `poliastro`

> *\"My team and I used Poliastro for our final project in our Summer
> App Space program. This module helped us in plotting asteroids by
> using the data provided to us. It was very challenging finding a
> module that can take orbits from the orbital elements, plot planets,
> and multiple ones. This module helped us because we were able to
> understand the code as most of us were beginners and make some changes
> the way we wanted our project to turn out. We made small changes such
> as taking out the axis and creating a function that will create
> animations. I am happy we used Poliastro because it helped us directs
> us in a direction where we were satisfied of our final product.\"*
>
> \-- Nayeli Ju (2017)

> *\"We are a group of students at University of Illinois at
> Urbana-Champaign, United States. We are currently working on a student
> AIAA/AAS satellite competition to design a satellite perform some
> science missions on asteroid (469219) 2016 HO3. We are using your
> hapsira python package in designing and visualizing the trajectory
> from GEO into asteroid's orbit. Thank you for your work on hapsira,
> especially the APIs that are very clear and informational, which helps
> us significantly.\"*

>
> *\"We, at the Institute of Space and Planetary Astrophysics (ISPA,
> University of Karachi), are using Poliastro as part of Space Flight
> Dynamics Text Book development program. The idea is to develop a book
> suitable for undergrad students which will not only cover theoretical
> background but will also focus on some computational tools. We chose
> Poliastro as one of the packages because it was very well written and
> provided results with good accuracy. It is especially useful in
> covering some key topics like the Lambert\'s problem. We support the
> use of Poliastro and open source software because they are easily
> accessible to students (without any charges, unlike some other tools).
> A great plus point for Poliastro is that it is Python based and Python
> is now becoming a very important tool in areas related to Space
> Sciences and Technologies.\"*

```{note}
Older versions of `poliastro`, from which `hapsira` was forked, relied on some Fortran subroutines written by David A. Vallado for his book \"Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications\" and available on the Internet as the [companion software of the book](http://celestrak.com/software/vallado-sw.asp). The author explicitly gave permission to redistribute these subroutines in this project under a permissive license.
